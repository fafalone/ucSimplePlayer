# ucSimplePlayer v1.1.3
Simple video player UserControl/ActiveX Control

This is a simple video player UserControl for VB6, twinBASIC, and VBA, supporting both 32bit and 64bit. It's just a thin wrapper over the `IMFPMediaPlayer` media player control that's part of Windows Media Foundation. While MS recommends using `IMFEngine`, that doesn't support Windows 7. 

All the basic features are covered:

- Play
- Pause
- Stop
- Volume
- Mute
- Balance
- Seek
- Playback rate
- Duration
- Fullscreen

The VB6 project file and ucSimplePlayDemo.twinproj have basic players implementing the control and its functions using the control as a UserControl.
  
ucSimplePlayer.twinproj is to compile an OCX which you could then use in VB6/tB plus other hosts like VBA 32bit/64bit.

It will automatically toggle full screen when you double click the video, to disable this change `.AllowFullscreen` to `False`. You can still use the manual toggle (`.Fullscreen = True/False`),

**Requirements**\
Windows 7 or newer\
VB6, twinBASIC, or VBA
 
**Usage in VBA**\
VBA can only use this project as an OCX. Use twinBASIC (run it as admin) to compile the OCX matching your Office bitness, it will automatically register. 

Alternatively, download the OCX matching the bitness of your MS Office version from the [Releases section](https://github.com/fafalone/ucSimplePlayer/releases), and register it with regsvr32.
> [!TIP]
> If you don't know whether you have 32bit or 64bit Office, go to File->Account then click 'About Excel/Access/etc'

Once you've done one of the options above, ucSimplePlayer should be available in the Tools->Additional controls dialog under "Simple Video Player Control v1.1", available when you're editing a UserForm in Excel VBA, or 'ActiveX Controls' in the Access form designer-- the menu that pops up from the dropdown button on the righthand side of the built-in controls box.

Tested in MS Office Excel 2021 64bit.
